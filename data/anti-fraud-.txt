## Anti-Fraud 

We at BankDhofar believe in safeguarding the interests of our customers and that is why we find it necessary to bring this to your attention. There are fraudulent e-mails requesting customers of various banks, asking them to update sensitive account information such as debit card and credit card numbers, user IDs, passwords etc. by clicking on an e-mail or by visiting a website.

**Please note:**

**Security Tips:**

* **Device Security:** It is important to use up-to-date anti-virus software and a personal firewall. You should be vigilant if you use internet cafes or a computer that is not your own and over which you have no control.
* **Check for spyware:** Use software to remove spyware from your computer, as these programs record information about your interest use and transmit it without your permission.
* **Keep your identity private offline:** Your identity can be as easily stolen offline as it can online. It is important that you comply with instructions about destroying new PIN numbers and expired bank cards.
* **Ensure you log off properly:** It is important to completely log off from your internet banking session, simply closing the window you performed the transaction in may not close the banking session. If your computer is infected with a Trojan, your session may become hijacked by a criminal and financial transactions may be performed without your knowledge. It is also advisable to disconnect from the internet if you are not planning to use it.

We would like to emphasize that BankDhofar will never solicit such information and we consider your privacy and security a priority. With your best interest always in mind, we ensure that banking with BankDhofar is a safe and secure experience.
