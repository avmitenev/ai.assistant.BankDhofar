## IBAN - Bank Dhofar

IBAN stands for the International Bank Account Number (IBAN). An IBAN is a unique number that is generated for each and every account held with Bank Dhofar. The IBAN for Oman will be 23 digits in length and will contain the following information; Country Code, Check Digits, Bank Identifier Code followed by your current Bank Account Number.

No, IBAN will not replace your existing Account number. Additional characters will appear in front of the existing bank account number and the whole sequence of alpha numeric digits will be known as the IBAN.

An IBAN can always be distinguished from a normal account number by the following:

* Two letters at the beginning of the IBAN, which refer to the country code where the account resides;
* Two numbers (in the third and fourth position of the IBAN) which represents check digits;
* Three numbers (after the check digits) to identify the respective bank where the beneficiary maintains his/her account; and the last 16 numeric digits represent the beneficiary account number with leading zeros. The length of IBAN in Oman is 23 characters.

An IBAN identifies a specific bank account, while a SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) code is used to identify the bank itself. The SWIFT code is used to route international payments between banks, while the IBAN is used to identify the specific account that the payment should be credited to.

The main benefit of IBAN is to facilitate the automatic processing of money transfers between countries which are IBAN compliant. Since banks are required to check the accuracy of the IBAN at the point of initiating a funds transfer, they can only make the funds transfer which carry the correct IBAN.
